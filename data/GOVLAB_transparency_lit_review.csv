Through two rounds of village meetings, NGOs encouraged communities to be more involved with the state of health service provision and strengthened their capacity to hold their local health providers to account for performance. A year after the intervention, treatment communities are more involved in monitoring the provider, and the health workers appear to exert higher effort to serve the community. We document large increases in utilization and improved health outcomes-reduced child mortality and increased child weight-that compare favorably to some of the more successful community-based intervention trials reported in the medical literature."

The campaign consisted of eight or nine public meetings in each of 340 treatment villages to disseminate information to the community about its state-mandated roles and responsibilities in school management. ... Two to four months after the intervention, we find that treatment had a positive impact in all three states. However, there are differences across states in where the impact occurs. The most notable impacts occurred on teacher effort, while impacts on learning were more modest. Some improvements also occurred in the delivery of benefits entitled to students (stipend, uniform and mid-day meal) and in process variables such as community participation in each of the three states. Future research needs to examine whether there is a systematic increase in learning when the impact is measured over a longer time period ..."
Monitoring corruption: Evidence from a field experiment in Indonesia,"Olken, Benjamin",2007,Journal of Political Economy,Indonesia,Southeast Asia,0,NA,0,NA,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,0,NA,0,NA,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,4,1,3,2,1,3,1,3,0,1,http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/517935,"This paper presents a randomized field experiment on reducing corruption in over 600 Indonesian village road projects. I find that increasing government audits from 4 percent of projects to 100 percent reduced missing expenditures, as measured by discrepancies between official project costs and an independent engineers' estimate of costs, by eight percentage points. By contrast, increasing grassroots participation in monitoring had little average impact, reducing missing expenditures only in situations with limited free-rider problems and limited elite capture. Overall, the results suggest that traditional top-down monitoring can play an important role in reducing corruption, even in a highly corrupt environment."

Report cards: The impact of providing school and child test scores on educational markets.,"Andrabi, Tahir; Das, Jishnu; Khwaja, Asim Ijaz",2014,World Bank Working Paper Series,Pakistan,Southeast Asia,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,1,1,0,NA,0,NA,1,1,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,4,1,1,3,1,1,3,0,3,1,0,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2587518,"We study the impact of providing report cards with school and child test scores on changes in test scores, prices, and enrollment in markets with multiple public and private dchool providers. ... After testing Grade 3 children in all schools, we distributed report cards in a randomly selected half of the villages. Report card provision increased test scores by 0.11 standard deviations for the average child enrolled in the village, decreased private school fees by 20 percent and increased primary enrollment by five percent. The test score gains are driven by children improving their scores rather than compositional changes in student populations. Consistent with canonical models of separating equilibria under asymmetric information, we find heterogeneity in the impact of the treatment by initial school quality. Private schools with low baseline scores show large test score gains, and public schools show moderate gains. Private schools with high baseline test scores show no gains in test scores, but large declines in school fees. We present supporting evidence that changes in school rather than household investments led to the observed improvements in test scores. "

Since test score disclosure has no impact on student composition and school observable inputs in both public and private schools, our results suggest that test score disclosure changes the behavior of teachers and school managers in private schools by affecting the market incentives faced by such schools.

This paper explores this by considering Chile's SNED program, which seeks to identify effective schools, selecting them from “homogeneous groups” of comparable institutions. Its results are widely disseminated, and the information it generates is different from that conveyed by a simple test-based ranking of schools (which turns out to approximate a ranking based on socioeconomic status). We use a sharp regression discontinuity to estimate the effect that being identified as a SNED winner has on schools' enrollment, tuition levels, and socioeconomic composition. Through five applications of the program, we find no consistent evidence that winning a SNED award affects these outcomes."

I ask how effective recourse to a freedom-of-information law is in comparison to bribery for both slum dwellers and middle-class individuals in India as they apply for basic public services. I demonstrate that applicants who make use of the freedom-of-information law attain almost the same rate of success as those who bribe. Recourse to a freedom-of-information law comes close to erasing class differences; that is, it results in comparable processing times for slum dwellers and middle-class individuals."

We analyze data on capture of public expenditures by local officials in Madagascar. Our findings indicate important constraints on decentralization of public service delivery, in particular in remote areas. Capture could be successfully constrained through a combination of media programs and monitoring. Intensive monitoring and access to media reduce capture. However, the impact of media is conditional on characteristics of the population. In areas with high illiteracy in poor regions, the effectiveness of newspaper and poster campaigns is limited, and radio and television programs are more important to reduce capture. "
Transparency Pays? Evaluating the Effects of the Freedom of Information Laws on Perceived Government Corruption,"Vadlamannati, Krishna Chaitanya; Cooray, Arusha",2017,Journal of Development Studies,NA,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,1,2,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,6,4,1,3,NA,3,3,0,1,0,1,http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00220388.2016.1178385,"About 90 countries have adopted Freedom of Information (FOI) laws with the objective of facilitating citizens' right to access information on government activities expeditiously. It is argued that FOI laws increase transparency and fix accountability of the government. We provide quantitative evidence on the impact of FOI laws on perceived government corruption. Using panel data for 132 countries over the 1990-2011 period, we find that adopting FOI laws after controlling for self-section bias, is associated with an increase in perceived government corruption driven by an increase in detection of corrupt acts. In fact, FOI laws appear to increase the perception of government corruption if combined with a higher degree of media freedom, presence of NGO activism and political competition. However, the perception of government corruption tends to decline with the duration of FOI law adoption. These findings are robust to controlling for endogeneity using instrumental variables, alternative samples and estimation methods."
Do freedom of information laws improve bureaucratic efficiency? An empirical investigation,"Vadlamannati, Krishna Chaitanya; Cooray, Arusha",2016,Oxford Economic Papers,NA,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,1,1,0,NA,1,1,0,NA,0,NA,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,6,4,1,3,NA,3,3,0,1,0,1,https://academic.oup.com/oep/article/68/4/968/2503353,"Previous studies find that adopting Freedom of Information (FOI) laws increase reporting of corruption, as this facilitates the right of access to governmental information. Thus, it is argued that FOI laws increase transparency and enhance government accountability. However, whether or not adopting such transparency laws improves bureaucratic efficiency remains unexplored. We provide first quantitative evidence on the impact of FOI laws on bureaucratic efficiency. Using panel data on 132 countries from 1990 to 2011, we find that adopting FOI laws, and in particular 'stronger' FOI laws, is associated with an improvement in bureaucratic efficiency, after controlling for self-section bias. FOI laws appear to be more effective in the long run, and if combined with a higher degree of media freedom, presence of non-governmental organization activism, and political competition. These findings are robust to controlling for endogeneity using instrumental variables, alternative samples, and estimation methods."
Do Freedom of Information Laws Decrease Corruption?,"Costa, Samia",2013,Journal of Law Economics & Organization,NA,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,1,2,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,6,4,1,3,NA,3,3,0,1,0,1,https://academic.oup.com/jleo/article/29/6/1317/989708,"International organizations have encouraged countries to adopt Freedom of Information (FOI) laws as a means to increase transparency and thus combat corruption. This article uses the recent introduction of FOI laws in several countries as a natural experiment to determine their effect on corruption perceptions and the quality of governance. Using different corruption perception indices, both at the macro- and micro-level, I find that countries that adopted FOI laws saw an increase in perceived corruption and a decrease in the quality of governance, rather than the expected improvement. This increase in corruption perception seems to take place in the initial years of the reform, with no significant decrease in the long term. Countries with a free press appear to be the ones experiencing the increase. Results are robust throughout different samples and specifications."
The Political Economy of Public Employee Absence: Experimental Evidence from Pakistan.,"Callen, Michael; Gulzar, Saad; Hasanain, Ali; Khan, Yasir",2016,Working Paper,Pakistan,South Asia,0,NA,0,NA,1,1,0,NA,1,1,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,5,2,1;3,3,2;3,1,3,0,3,1,0,http://www.nber.org/papers/w22340,"This paper presents evidence that one cause of absenteeism in the public sector is that government jobs are handed out as patronage. First, politicians routinely interfere when bureaucrats sanction absent doctors, and doctors are more absent in uncompet- itive constituencies and when connected to politicians. Next, we find that the effects of two experimental interventions to address absence are attenuated in uncompetitive constituencies and for connected doctors. The first is a smartphone monitoring technology that nearly doubles inspection rates, and the second, representing the first experiment on the effects of providing data to policymakers, channels real time infor- mation on doctor absence."
Does Political Oversight of the Bureaucracy Increase Accountability? Field Experimental Evidence from an Electoral Autocracy.,"Raffler, Pia",2016,Working Paper,Uganda,Africa,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,2,4,2,3,2,1,3,0,3,0,0,http://piaraffler.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Raffler_JMP.pdf,"How can consistently poor service delivery by governments in developing countries be im- proved? While a growing literature focuses on strengthening the accountability of politicians to voters, little research considers how politicians’ control over the bureaucracy influences ser- vice provision. In collaboration with the Ugandan Ministry of Finance, I conducted a field experiment involving 2,800 government officials across 260 local governments. The objective of the intervention was to empower local politicians to exercise closer oversight over the lo- cal bureaucracy through the dissemination of highly disaggregated budgetary information and trainings about their mandate and rights. In a second treatment arm, these tools were also of- fered to politicians’ opponents in an attempt to stimulate political competition. I find that the intervention increased local politicians’ monitoring effort and the frequency with which they seek to improve service delivery, but only in areas with some degree of party competition. Of- fering the tools to political opponents did not have a differential effect. In contrast to scholars who argue that insulating technocrats allows them to do their jobs more effectively with less corruption, these findings imply that politicians engage in pro-social political oversight even in the context of an electoral autocracy, as long as a modicum of party competition exists, thus opening up the potential to improve service delivery in the longer term."

I conclude that specific management practices such as performance monitoring, targets set- ting and incentive schemes have significant positive impacts on 8th-graders’ math scores, es- pecially on low performance students. I was unable to obtain similar results for language. I further investigated whether these results were associated with student or staff selection and infrastructure investments or whether they were actually driven by changes to pedagogical and managerial practices. My findings suggest that the latter explanation is more plausible."
"E-Governance, Accountability, and Leakage in Public Programs: Experimental Evidence from a Financial Management Reform in India.","Banerjee, Abhijit; Duflo, Esther; Imbert, Clement; Mathew, Santhosh; Pande, Rohini",2016,NBER Working Paper,India,South Asia,0,NA,0,NA,1,0,0,NA,0,NA,1,2,1,1,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,5,4,3,3,2,1,3,0,2,0,0,http://www.nber.org/papers/w22803,"In collaboration with the Government of Bihar, India, we conducted a large-scale experiment to evaluate whether transparency in fiscal transfer systems can increase accountability and reduce corruption in the implementation of a workfare program. The reforms introduced electronic fund- flow, cut out administrative tiers, and switched the basis of transfer amounts from forecasts to documented expenditures. Treatment reduced leakages along three measures: expenditures and hours claimed dropped while an independent household survey found no impact on actual employment and wages received; a matching exercise reveals a reduction in fake households on payrolls; and local program officials’ self-reported median personal assets fell."
Putting a band-aid on a corpse: Incentives for nurses in the Indian public health care system,"Banerjee, Abhijit; Glennerster, Rachel; Duflo, Esther",2008,Journal of the European Economic Association,India,South Asia,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,1,3,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,5,2,2,3,2,1,3,0,2;3,0,0,https://academic.oup.com/jeea/article/6/2-3/487/2295851,"The public Indian health care system is plagued by high staff absence, low effort by providers, and limited use by potential beneficiaries who prefer private alternatives. This artice reports the results of an experiment carried out with a district administration and a nongovernmental organization (NGO). The presence of government nurses in government public health facilities (subcenters and aid-posts) was recorded by the NGO, and the government took steps to punish the worst delinquents. Initially, the monitoring system was extremely effective. This shows that nurses are responsive to financial incentives. But after a few months, the local health administration appears to have undermined the scheme from the inside by letting the nurses claim an increasing number of “exempt days.” Eighteen months after its inception, the program had become completely ineffective."
Yardstick Competition in a Federation: Theory and Evidence from China,"Caldeira, Emilie",2012,China Economic Review,India,East Asia,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,5,4,2,2,NA,7,2,0,1;2,0,0,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X1200034X,"In this paper, we test empirically for competition among Chinese provinces embedded in a centralized political system. To motivate the empirical work, we adapt Besley and Case's model (American Economic Review, 1995) to a model of yardstick competition ‘from the top’. In this model, the central government (rather than local voters) creates competition among local officials by rewarding or punishing them on the basis of relative performance in providing public services. Our theoretical framework predicts that, in this context, the central government spurs strategic interactions among governors with similar environments as voters do in democratic countries. Then, for the first time in our knowledge, by estimating a spatial lag dynamic model for a panel data of 29 Chinese provinces from 1980 to 2004, we provide empirical evidence of the existence of such public spending interactions. We propose a rigorous empirical framework which takes into account heterogeneity, endogeneity problems and spatial error dependence. The results tend to confirm the existence of strategic interactions among geographically and economically close Chinese provinces, operating in a vertical bureaucratic control system."
Pay for locally monitored performance: A welfare analysis for teacher attendance in Ugandan primary schools,"Cilliers, Jacobus; Kasirye, Ibrahim; Leaver, Clare",2016,Working Paper,Uganda,Africa,0,NA,0,NA,1,1,0,NA,1,0,0,NA,1,0,1,3,0,NA,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,5,1,3,3,2,1,3,0,1,0,0,https://ideas.repec.org/p/ags/eprcop/244098.html,"Public sector organizations often rely on reports by local monitors that are costly to verify and that serve twin objectives: to incentivize agent performance, and to provide information for planning purposes. Received wisdom has it that pay for locally monitored performance (P4LMP) will result in collusion and undermine both objectives. But simple Coasian logic suggests the reverse: P4LMP puts transferable money on the table and may enable interested parties to bargain to a more efficient outcome. This paper develops a theoretical model that shows why, and for which parameters, the welfare-enhancing Coasian scenario exists. Focusing on education, we model how the preferences of a teacher (agent) and head-teacher (local monitor) affect actual and reported teacher attendance, and how these equilibrium outcomes depend on the financial stakes attached to reports. To capture the value of information, we also consider the welfare of a bureaucracy that makes a costly policy mistake when holding the wrong belief about teacher performance. We test the model and estimate the predicted effects using data from a field experiment in Ugandan primary schools, randomly varying whether head teachers’ reports of teacher attendance are tied to bonus payments or not. Consistent with Coasian logic, P4LMP increased actual and reported teacher attendance (by 9 and 15 percentage points respectively) and reduced policy mistakes (by 7 percentage points) relative to unincentivized local monitoring. We use these experimental impacts to undertake a detailed cost-benefit analysis and conclude, even under conservative assumptions, that welfare improved when paying for locally monitored performance."
"Accountability, Career incentives, and Pollution Ñ The Case of Two Control Zones in China","Chen, Yvonne Jie; Li, Pei; Lu, Yi",2016,Working paper,China,East Asia,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,1,1,0,NA,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,5,4,2,2,NA,4,3,0,1;2,0,0,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2703239,"We provide empirical evidence on the effectiveness of target-based performance evaluation for bureau- crats in the context of the Two Control Zones policy in China. In 2006, the Chinese central government made sulphur dixoide (SO2) emissions cuts a major performance evaluation criterion for prefectural city mayors and party secretaries. We compare emissions reductions in these so-called Two Control Zone cities, where more stringent emissions quotas were imposed, with reductions in non-control cities. Our results suggest that the new evaluation system is effective in achieving the target policy output. Adding the emission cuts into local bureaucrats’ performance evaluation significantly reduces the actual SO2 emissions. We further analyze the channels through which the policy operates and show that the new evaluation system changes bureaucrats’ behavior and induces them to exert more effort on controlling environmental pollution."
Deal with the devil: The success and limitations of bureaucratic reform in India.,"Dhaliwal, Iqbal; Hanna, Rema",2014,Working paper,India,South Asia,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,1,1,0,NA,1,3,1,1,0,NA,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,5,2,2,3,2,1,3,0,2,0,0,http://www.nber.org/papers/w20482,"Employing a technological solution to monitor the attendance of public-sector health care workers in India resulted in a 15 percent increase in the attendance of the medical staff. Health outcomes improved, with a 16 percent increase in the delivery of infants by a doctor and a 26 percent reduction in the likelihood of infants born under 2500 grams. However, women in treatment areas substituted away from the newly monitored health centers towards delivery in the (unmonitored) larger public hospitals and private hospitals. Several explanations may help explain this shift: better triage by the more present health care staff; increased patients’ perception of absenteeism in the treatment health centers; and the ability of staff in treatment areas to gain additional rents by moving women to their private practices and by siphoning off the state-sponsored entitlements that women would normally receive at the health center at the time of delivery. Despite initiating the reform on their own, there was a low demand among all levels of government–state officials, local level bureaucrats, and locally- elected bodies—to use the better quality attendance data to enforce the government’s human resource policies due to a fear of generating discord among the staff. These fears were not entirely unfounded: staff at the treatment health centers expressed greater dissatisfaction at their jobs and it was also harder to hire new nurses, lab technicians and pharmacists at the treatment health centers after the intervention. Thus, this illustrates the implicit deal that governments make on non-monetary dimensions—truancy, allowance of private practices—to retain staff at rural outposts in the face of limited budgets and staff shortages."
Why resource-poor dictators allow freer media: theory and evidence from panel data,"Egorov, Georgy; Guriev, Sergei; Sonin, Konstantin",2009,American Political Science Review,NA,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,5,4,2,3,NA,7,2,0,1;2,0,0,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/why-resource-poor-dictators-allow-freer-media-a-theory-and-evidence-from-panel-data/92630F67EA4FB71E493FAA12D429A056,"Every dictator dislikes free media. Yet, many nondemocratic countries have partially free or almost free media. In this article, we develop a theory of media freedom in dictatorships and provide systematic statistical evidence in support of this theory. In our model, free media allow a dictator to provide incentives to bureaucrats and therefore to improve the quality of government. The importance of this benefit varies with the natural resource endowment. In resource-rich countries, bureaucratic incentives are less important for the dictator; hence, media freedom is less likely to emerge. Using panel data, we show that controlling for country fixed effects, media are less free in oil-rich economies, with the effect especially pronounced in nondemocratic regimes. These results are robust to model specification and the inclusion of various controls, including the level of economic development, democracy, country size, size of government, and others."

We present evidence consistent with the hypothesis that both the central government and the public are placing pressure on China's urban leaders to mitigate externalities. Such “pro-green” incentives suggest that many of China's cities could enjoy significant environmental progress in the near future."
